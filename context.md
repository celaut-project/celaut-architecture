In 1970, the British mathematician John Horton Conway introduced a cellular automaton called "The Game of Life." A cellular automaton serves as a mathematical and computational model for a dynamic system that evolves in discrete steps.

The Game of Life suggests that, through a set of simple rules, complex structures can emerge. This system consists of a group of agents (or cells) that occupy a space and follow rules that dictate their interactions with other agents. In a way, this mirrors the evolution of a living ecosystem, constantly improving and optimizing processes without conscious intention.

This same principle can be applied to the capacity of competitive economic systems to enhance their processes. When a company explores new technologies to reduce costs, it does so not for the common good but to outperform rivals. Yet, unconsciously, it contributes to the common good. The market will determine whether the new approach to a task is more optimal or not.

Competition of ideas, processes, and methods is what allows us to improve our way of life. For instance, in industrial or logistical processes, if someone devises a more efficient method, they create a company to implement it. If it proves better than the traditional method, it gains a larger market share, surpassing the previous approach.

However, real-world evolution is slow to observe due to the time required for tangible results. Conversely, in simulated environments, new action proposals can be observed much faster, considering more options and allowing for the immediate application of the best approach.

The computer revolution of recent decades provides us with the ability to simulate and automate processes. A network of computers with these capabilities has been established, offering tremendous potential. Cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence promise a significant improvement in our quality of life, primarily through their potential to automate tasks beyond previous imagination.

In a cellular automaton, the fewer and/or less complex the rules governing agent interactions, the broader the spectrum of complexity the automaton can achieve. In other words, more rules lead to greater limitations.
